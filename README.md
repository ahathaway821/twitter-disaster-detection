### Problem Overview
Emergency responders and news outlets monitor twitter for signs of natural or human-driven disasters. The 2014 Earthquakes in Silicon Valley were detected in 29 seconds using twitter data! How the USGS uses Twitter to track earthquakes Teams will have access to data (see data tab for more info) containing tweets from individuals corresponding to a few different types of disasters mixed with tweets from the same time period. Our quest is to create a model which predicts whether or not a tweet seems to pertain to a disaster and then create a visualization/presentation describing findings, insights and your teams approach. The visualization/presentation will be evaluated at Demo/Celebration time.
